        <h2>What is OpenFisca ?</h2>

        <p>
            OpenFisca is an open microsimulation software of French socio-fiscal system. It allows users to simply
            calculate many social benefits and taxes paid by households and simulate
            the impact of reforms on their budget.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is an educational tool intended to help citizens better
            understand the socio-fiscal system.
        </p>

            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>OpenFisca calculates the amounts of payroll taxes, taxes, and benefits using:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the household's characteristic, as indicated by the user
                    </li>
                    <li>a <strong>simplified</strong>
                    and <strong>approximate</strong> model of the socio-fiscal legislation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These amounts are given only as indicators and may 
                differ from those determined by various authorities
                for your real situation. The results cannot be held against the administration,
                the Caf or more generally, against any organization 
                involved in the calculation of taxes and benefits. 
                In fact, your family situation and / or resources may change or may not have been 
                taken into account in the simulation. Some simplifying hypothesis may have been made.

        <h2>History of OpenFisca</h2>

        <p>
        The development of OpenFisca began in May 2011 at the <abbr title = "Centre d'analyse stratégique"> 
        CAS </ abbr>, whose name was changed to  <abbr title = "Commissariat général à la stratégie et à la
prospective"> CGSP </ abbr> in spring 2013,  with the support 
        of the <abbr title = "Institut d'économie publique"> 
        IDEP </ abbr>. The source code has been released under a
        free license in November 2011. OpenFisca was originally 
        developed as an integrated desktop application (Qt) with a Python API.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Etalab started being implicated in the development of OpenFisca, in the early 2014, it was decided to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                separate the simulator's engine and its user interface (Qt)
            </li>
            <li>
                offer a <strong>web API</strong>, in addition to the Python API,
                and favor the first it over the latter.
            </li>
            <li>
                demonstrate the value of Web API by developing sample applications including
                a web interface to simulate personal cases
            </li>
            <li>
                
               propose a <strong> public access to this web API </ strong>, 
               open to all : administrations, researchers, citizens, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since then, the software is being developed extensively by Etalab.
            Meanwhile the economic model is being improved and the socio-fiscal legislation updated by the
            <abbr title="Commissariat général à la stratégie et à la prospective">CGSP</abbr>,
            with the help of the <abbr title="Institut d'économie
            publique">IDEP</abbr> and the <abbr title="Institut des
            politiques publiques">IPP</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of now (March 2014), the Qt version is no longer maintained and
            only the web version is being developped.
        </p>

        <h2>Non French versions of OpenFisca</h2>

        <p>
            The OpenFisca engine is generic. It is therefore completely 
            independent of the socio-tax legislation. It is therefore possible to simulate
            any socio-fiscal system. The Tunisian version of OpenFisca is currently under development as well.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            The Tunisian version is currently (March 2014), less advanced than the French version. But this is  only
            due to a shortage in manpower to enter and update the Tunisian socio-fiscal legislation.
